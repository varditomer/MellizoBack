## Project Clone and Installation

# Cloning the Repository:
```
Before cloning the repository, ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the project.
If required, contact the author or project maintainer to obtain access.

Navigate to the required folder on your machine where you want to store the project.
Once you've selected a folder, open VSCode, open a terminal.

Clone the repository into this folder using the following Git command:
git clone https://github.com/varditomer/MellizoBack.git
```
# Installing Dependencies
```
After cloning the repository, navigate into the project directory:
cd MellizoFront

You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
node -v
npm -v
```

# If npm Is Not Installed
```
If the npm -v command does not show a version number or returns an error, it means npm is not installed. In that case:

Install Node.js and npm.
npm is included with Node.js, so you only need to install Node.js.
Visit the Node.js official website.
Download the installer for your operating system.
Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.
After installation, reopen your terminal or command prompt.
Verify the installation by running node -v and npm -v again.
Once npm is installed, you can run npm install in your project directory to install all necessary dependencies.
```

# install the project dependencies using npm
```
run the following command to install all the dependencies listed in your project's package.json file:
npm install
```
# Usage
```
Once the installation of the project dependencies is complete, you can run the following command to run your project:
npm run dev
```
